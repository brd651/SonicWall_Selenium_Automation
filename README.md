# SonicWall_Selenium_Automation
Just some WebUI automation for SonicWall UTM.

This code string logs into the SonicWall then goes to Intrusion Prevention and opens the Exclusion window then clicks okay button. 

Just some testing across the features using Selenium and can be re-used to test other WebUI features of the SonicWall product.
